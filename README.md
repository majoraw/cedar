# Cedar
Cedar - a blockchain based framework to make it easier to develop secure microservices applications
# Welcome to the Cedar Project
The Cedar Project is created with one primary objective - to provide an alternative approach to microservices application security based on blockchain and distributed technologies.

# Control Application
A microservice application developed with Java and the secured using the Spring Secuirty Framework and based NIST/ISO27001 security requirements for microservices applications

# Experimental Application
The same microservices application is developed using Cedar Framework 

# Benchmark Tests
Benchmark tests and run on both applications and results compared 

# Features of the Framework
The framework uses smart contracts to implement
* Authentication
* Authorisation
* API Security - protect microservices APIs from attacks and data breaches - runtime application self protection
	* Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Information
	* Data Exfiltration
	* Denial of Service
	* Account takeover/misuse
	* Outdated/Zombie APIs
	* Schema validation
* Software Bill of Materials
* Service Discovery
